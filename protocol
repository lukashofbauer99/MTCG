Designs:
I followed the SOLID, Priciples as good as possible, and implemented Patterns like the Decorator-Patter for the Effects
created IRepositories and split them up so that the Interface would not get to big
used a clear class and folder structure to keep things organized

Failures:
Getting the curl scripts working in Spring as automated Tests didnt work so well, executing curls scripts via java, leads to weird behaviour, therefore i spent more time then i would have thought for them, 

Selected solutions:
I selected and developed the solutions that i have now, because it was what i could produce in a bit over the time that this course should take us, there sure is room for improvement, but for me and my skills that would have taken longer( or a Framework like Spring ;) )

Tests:
The tests cover the whole Project quite well, 
because i tried Testdriven-Design i tested quite thoroughly
I tested each component and its functionality with a bit over 200 unit tests  and integration tests

Time Spent:
about 80 hours
